	<h2>1) Stay organized</h2>
	<p>It’s so much easier to become frustrated when you’re disorganized. Try to keep a <strong>routine</strong> and keep your workplace <em>clean</em> and <em>organized</em>. If you have a routine, you’ll be less likely to procrastinate and leave off all your work until the last minute. In other words, if you have a routine, you’ll be a lot <strong>less</strong> stressed out!</p>

	<h2>2) Sleep</h2>
	<p>I know it’s tempting to stay up all night and watch Netflix…</p><br><img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/3oxHQoanDp7gzgv13q/giphy.webp" alt="sleep"><br><p>…but sleep smart! Sleep is <strong>integral</strong> for <strong>healthy</strong> brain function. Although it’s very difficult to maintain eight full hours of sleep during the school year, it’s <em>important</em> to try to get as much sleep as is possible. Spend <em>less</em> time vegetating on social media and more time catching those z’s! </p>
	
	<h2>3) Stay Active</h2>
	<p>Physical exercise is <em>essential</em> for a healthy lifestyle. It’s also a great way to <strong>de-stress</strong>. Try doing some jumping jacks in between study sessions—or going for a brisk walk. Yoga is  also great ways to <em>relieve</em> tension! Sign up for a  weight lifting class or buy a yoga mat and learn online! Also, you can follow health and wellness sites on social media like Men's Health and Women's Health, or download an exercise app on your phone that keeps track of your steps which could <strong>motivate</strong> you to do some exercises at home.</p>

	<h2>4) Study in a group</h2>
	<p>Oftentimes, studying with friends or people you are comfortable with is optimal for relieving stress. You can know you’re not suffering alone, and you can try try all sorts of group study methods. Try quizzing each other, discussing key topics, and asking them your questions—if you conduct the study session right, it can be very fun and very productive.</p>

	<h2>5) Laugh!</h2>
	<p>Laughing really is the best medicine. Or, at least, it’s excellent at de-stressing! Scientific studies have proven that laughing eases stress and lowers blood pressure. So, even if you’re really not in the mood for it, laugh! Watch some funny videos on Youtube or remember a funny memory, and you’ll be guaranteed to feel a lot less stressed.</p>

	<h2>6) Eat Healthy Meals</h2>
	<p>Eating definitely helps in stressful situations.  Certain foods, like fruits and vegetables are scientifically proven to contain happiness-boosting nutrients and ingredients. Why is eating important for students? Research has shown that students are able to learn better when they're well nourished, and eating healthy meals has been linked to higher grades, better memory and alertness, and faster information processing. So the next time you’re feeling down, try chomping down on some some good nutritious food!</p>
